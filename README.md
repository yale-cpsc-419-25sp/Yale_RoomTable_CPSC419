# RoomTable

## Project Group 2
Brandon Nguyen, Angelica Pham, Kevin Guillen, Mandy Zhang, Briley Thomas

## Summary 
We want to create a CourseTable for Yale College housing where Yale students can
search for information (e.g. location, room configurations) about the different suites available in
each residential college. To streamline the housing process, the web application would also integrate
housing spreadsheets, where students can declare their group formations and suite preferences. For
now, we will be building our site to only display Murray rooms and suites.
